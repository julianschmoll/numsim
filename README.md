# Fluid Solver

A parallel fluid solver written from scratch using navier stokes equations.

## Installation

In addition to a compiler and cmake you need `libvtk` to output simulation data which can be viewed with `paraview`.

## Usage

After building the program can be run with one of the scenarios in `./scenarios`. The output will be next to the executable.
The results of the simulation are saved in the output folder and can be visualized in Paraview.
