# should run the whole ml pipeline

# would be nice to parse the config file as cli argument here
# then this could build the cpp, generate training data, load the dataset
# train the dataset (should be possible to specify random parameters so we can let this run on a cluster)
# evaluate (ofc) and save the dataset alongside a config.json with the training parameters and a mymodel.py to initialize
